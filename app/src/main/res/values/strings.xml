    <string name="what_is_it_explanation">GoogleDialerMod is an app that allows, using root privileges, to modify the values contained in the Google Play Services "Phenotype" database, thus altering the behavior of the Google Dialer app to unlock experimental or blocked features in some countries.\n\nAlways make sure you are using the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.safetyhub">latest Dialer beta version available on the Play Store</a>, to take advantage of the latest features.</string>
    <string name="how_it_works_explanation">The patches applied by GoogleDialerMod resist Google Dialer updates over time, even after uninstalling the app.\nMods are therefore to be considered permanent, but they can be easily reverted by pressing the trash can icon in the top right menu.\nThere is no need to keep this app installed after applying the desired changes.\n\nAfter applying changes, you may need to forcibly reopen and close the Dialer app a couple of times before they take effect.</string>
    <string name="new_version_alert">A new version of GoogleDialerMod is available.\n\nYou can download it from Github\'s Releases page.</string>
